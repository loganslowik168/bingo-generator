To generate a Bingo card, create a .txt file with your potential cells.  Text should be one entry per line.  Then run `python3 main.py <input.txt>`

Generated bingo cards will be stored in a folder called `output_cards`.  Upon each run of the program given valid inputs, all previously generated card will be deleted.
